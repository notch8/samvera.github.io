### Display Sets

A managed grouping of resources for display and visibility, primarily oriented toward display of content to end users.  As such, they have organizational features like nesting, hierarchical browsing, discoverability, and membership in multiple Display Sets.

### Participants

Participants for Admin Sets allow the repository manager to define what individual types of users can do with or to items in an Admin Set.

### Workflows

The configurable path a work takes from submission to published into the repository. See [Mediated Deposit](#mediated-deposit).

### Permission Templates
